#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared helpers for the bash scripts in scripts/: status output, the app's identity (name, region,
# branch-selected stack pair) and loaders for the gitignored settings files, so every script
# resolves these values the same way and none re-declares them.
#
# Core responsibilities:
# - print_help / show_help: a script's header comment block, as its --help text
# - usage_error: the help and a message on stderr, exit 2, for an argument a script does not take
# - die/info/ok/warn/step: status lines; die exits 1 with the message on stderr, step prefixes the
#   wall-clock time and the time elapsed since the sourcing script started
# - split_lines: newline-separated command output into an array
# - load_aws_config / load_secrets: source the gitignored lib/aws-config.sh / lib/secrets.sh,
#   refusing a file git would track or a secret value that appears in a tracked file
# - assert_secrets_untracked: that check, also run on staged changes by .githooks/pre-commit
# - assert_addresses_untracked: the same for the email addresses of a private settings file
#   (PRIVATE_FILES), except the ones PUBLISHED_SETTINGS names
# - get_app_name / get_region / resolve_stack: the stack this checkout deploys to, and
#   STACK_NAMES, the stacks aws-helper.sh operates on
# - SAM_CLI_TELEMETRY: off for every sam command a script runs
# - LOG_RETENTION_DAYS: how long the stack's log groups keep their events
# - stack_outputs / stack_output: CloudFormation outputs of that stack
# - ensure_node_modules: npm ci in a package folder whose lockfile changed since its last install
# - this app's own helpers, at the end: load_params for the gitignored lib/params.sh,
#   resolve_stack_pair for the pair's Cognito stack, cognito_output, and cfn_query, a
#   CloudFormation lookup that answers empty for a stack not deployed yet
#
# Expects SCRIPT_DIR to point at scripts/ before it is sourced.

# The variables set here are read by the scripts that source this file.
